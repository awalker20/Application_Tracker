# Application_Tracker
This project is a job application tracker. It lets users keep track of jobs applied to in the past along with other features such as:

- Sort applications by company, position, date, etc...
- Add contact information to each application
- Set reminders to remind yourself about an application submitted
- Add your previous work experience

Java and JavaFX were used to build this application.
